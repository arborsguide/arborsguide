                <h2>Good Resources</h2>
                <p>I have found that many educational resources (websites, papers, textbooks, lectures, etc.) can be lacking in quality, which served as a major reasoning for creating this site. I have also found that there are some resources I've encountered which are actually quite good, and some that are truly excellent. These have either served as major references for me creating this site, or simply are high enough quality that I don't feel it necessary to create my own guides for the topics of these resources. The tricky thing about such resources is I often forget their names or mix them up, so this page has been created largely as a lookup table for my book-keeping. Addittionally, Arbor's Guide is not just meant to provide its own centralized knowledge pool, but also to serve as a core location for finding other resources.<br>
                <h2>Textbooks, Handbooks, and Encyclopedia</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Book of Proof (2020) - Richard Hammack | Have you ever started looking at mathematical proofs or raw math notations for concepts and struggled to interpret the many symbols and formalisms? This book is where to start if you want to solve that problem, it is a fantastic, grounded, introduction to the formal language of mathematics which has served well in supporting my study of group theory.</li>
                    <li>Group Theory and Its Application to the Quantum Mechanics of Atomic Spectra (1959) - Eugene P. Wigner | A text which I have barely begin to scratch the surface of, but which explores concepts with a level of thoroughness that it has already proved quite good to me. In particular I believe that anyone who was taught matrix multiplication at a young age, and never had the chance to take a linear algebra course, could benefit greatly from the formal definitions of matrices and their operations provided in the first chapter.</li>
                    <li>Purification of Laboratory Chemicals (2017, 8th edition) - Wilfred L. F. Armarego | I cannot begin to express how lovely this book is. It provides not only thorough discussion of purification techniques and practical strategies for engaging with them, but also a list of common compounds and reported purification methods for them, which has saved me many times.</li>
                    <li>Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry (2007) - Many Authors | For practicing academic researchers a text such as this should be browsed occasionally to remind ourselves of what large scale chemistry actually looks like, and where the common reagents we use come from. An essential text for being truly aware of the chemical world around you. Specifically, it is often possible to ctrl+F the name of a reagent in this text, wait ~3 minutes (searching 28000 pages takes a while), and find in a relatively quick fashion how such a reagent is used and created in industrial settings.</li>
                    <li>Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis (2002) | There have been many, many times that I have used this text to learn more about a reagent I am about to use, or which I have used and its behaved unusually. Simply a must-have text for the practicing synthetic chemist.</li>
                    <li>Determination of Organic Structures by Physical Methods (1955) - Editors E. A. Braude & F. C. Nachod | The section on acids and bases (~p567) is truly delightful in its thoroughness, though I plan to eventually create a guide which expands on that section of the text with additional visualizations and molecule classes.</li>
                    <li>Modern Physical Organic Chemistry (2006) - Eric V. Anslyn & Dennis A. Dougherty | An essential stepping stone for chemists who are looking to advance their fundamental understanding of molecules. I credit this text for first elucidating me to the complete falsehood that is sp3 hybridization (see p827 for a damning photoelectron spectrum of methane). I've yet to fully finish exploring this text but I highly recommend it. The latter section on electronic structure methods is also quite a good introduction to computational methods.</li>
                    <li>Strategic Applications of Named Reactions in Organic Synthesis (2005) - László Kürti and Barbara Czakó | Every practicing chemist should have this text, whether you do or don't do organic chemistry. For the former - it provides great details on named reactions and their variations. For the latter - you'll need this to translate what the organic chemists are saying.</li>
