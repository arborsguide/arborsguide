                <p><b><q>This is a book about color, and more truthfully, this is a book about understanding the world around you.</q></b></p>

                <p><i>Arbor's Guide</i> (this website!) and <i>Arbor's Guide to Color</i> (a yet to be released book compiling much of this site) were officially started in January of 2025. Arbor's Guide is intended to be a centralized, practical, and comprehensive source of information and tools to help myself and others understand the world around them, with a special focus on all topics related to color.<br></p>

                <p><b><q>Perhaps the most important and emergently complex questions that we as people can ever pose, begin simply, with <i>‘why.’</i></q></b></p>

                <p>An extensive discussion of the origins and objectives of Arbor's Guide can be found on <a href="MainPages\arborsguideorigins.html">this page</a>, and information on all other contributor's to the project can be found on <a href="#">this page</a>. With the introduction out of the way, go off and explore this Guide!<br>

                <p>
                    Objectives for Site Construction:
                    <br>- Figure out how to make multiple pages and link between them
                    <br>- Figure out how to make the rotating text guide logo in page header
                    <br>- Develop a search function, tag pages to allow for sorting by tags (advanced, low priority for now)
